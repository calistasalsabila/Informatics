# Informatics Repository

## About This Repository

This repository contains structured folders for all courses taken during the Informatics program. Each semester (smt1, smt2, smt3, ...) has its own subdirectory, which contains folders for individual courses. Inside each course folder, materials and tasks are organized into assignments, material, and UTS.

## Folder Descriptions

* **assignments/** → Coding exercises, weekly tasks, and homework.
* **material/** → Lecture slides, summaries, concept notes, and references.
* **UTS/** → Midterm preparation materials, problem sets, and solutions.

## Purpose

* Centralize all Informatics study materials.
* Track learning progress for each subject and semester.
* Maintain clear separation between assignments, materials, and assessments.
