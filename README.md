# 📌 Informatics Repository

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository contains structured folders for all courses taken during the Informatics program. Each semester (`smt1`, `smt2`, ...) has its own subdirectory, which contains folders for individual courses. Inside each course folder, materials and tasks are organized into `assignments`, `notes`, and `projects`.
